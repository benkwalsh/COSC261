Included is:
"PLYparser.py" analyzes a sequence of tokens or characters according to a specific grammar or set of rules.
"parser.py" does the same except it does not take advantage of the PLY library

"PLYscanner.py" is a lexer or tokenizer, it performs lexical analysis, which involves recognizing and categorizing individual tokens based on predefined patterns or regular expressions.
"scanner.py" does the same except it does not take advantage of the PLY library

The "compiler.py" program takes an input, a high level language, and outputs the assembly level language instructions. The input is translated to java assembly: "Program2.j"
